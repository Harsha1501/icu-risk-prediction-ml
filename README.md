# ICU Risk Prediction with Uncertainty-Aware Machine Learning

## Overview
This project develops machine learning models to predict clinical risk in ICU patients using time-series data. The models are **uncertainty-aware**, providing both predictions and confidence estimates to support reliable clinical decision-making.

## Features
- Predict patient risk trajectories in ICU
- Estimate prediction uncertainty for each prediction
- Preprocess and extract features from ICU time-series data
- Includes Jupyter notebooks for analysis and visualization
- Fully reproducible experiments with Python scripts
